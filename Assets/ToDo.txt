-------------------------------------------

- the units can hit a button to hold position and keep the pollution at bay.  this prevents pollution from spawning in a certain area around the unit.  the unit will gain
pollution stoppage skill while doing this.
- the units can also clean the pollution, which we've already implemented.
if the pollution starts out covering the entire field (or most of it), then it makes sense to try to get multiple units in -- some cleaning and some keeping the pollution at bay, and then having one of them make a "stay at bay" building and one make a "spawn" building.
- do the above as a base, core mechanic.  goal is to clear the field.

--> ok, above makes sense.

idea--> level 2 pollution -- maybe slower spreading... but need to upgrade yourselves to clean it/keep it at bay.

so part of the progression/constant danger is that the pollution is constantly spreading.

idea--> you can build an area -- the area defines how many units you can have.  

so you win if there is no pollution left in the whole level.


gameplay ideas:
building to spawn actor units
building to affect pollution
to function, buildings must be significantly pollution free
individual actor units can clean pollution, but better to automate
we probably need an "effects" layer --> lets entities check its status, affects gameplay, allows for visualization.
when a building is built or destroyed, update effects layer.
effects layer structure...  would be nice if it was a series of layers, where each was associated with a particular effect.  we might(?) have a mechanism for this alr?
--- so we do have the "Grid sub maps..."  can these work?
ok... the thing with grid sub maps is they require grid cells/grid transforms, which we don't want.
i think the easiest way to do this would just be have a completely independent component that handles effects.


-idea - different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

- again, get core game down first.

- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???) --> i don't' think this meshes with the flavor of "cleaning" the forest

//cancels for actions... ok but not necessary right now.
if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
