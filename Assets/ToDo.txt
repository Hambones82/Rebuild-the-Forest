- make a statset class, reimplement the comparison stuff i had done with the connectionset?  that way we can check if "has at least"
- on the other hand, i don't think we need to do adding/subtracting, whatever, so maybe we can make it a lot simpler...  


BUGS:
-----
when lots of actions to clean are queued, the pawn sometimes cleans pollution that is not the one he goes to.  this might have smoething to do with the combination
of the action object being initialized early and the object pool
- the problem is...  when you click to clean the same pollution twice.
- it'll allow the pollution to die and respawn somewhere else, with the pointer still pointing to the old pollution.
- need to think of a fix.


- so the fix will be, on disable, tell all actions targeting this item to cancel.  do this with a callback.  that means the action will have to hook up to the ondisable
- callback.  this means that we want our action to have the ability to have a target.  we can extend the unit action to either be generic or just to have a target...
- it makes sense to have the unit action save its target and to do this as a base class, because then we wouldn't have to repeat code.  so instead of just doing this for the
- pollution target thing, do it for all things that target an object.  
- so the thing that we're doing is we're simply storing the target.

- include data into scriptable object

-idea - different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

- again, get core game down first.

- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???)

//cancels for actions... ok but not necessary right now.
if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
