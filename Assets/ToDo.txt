need to fix the original roots thing...
fix the neighbor thing for roots --> not iscelloccupied (rootmanager, lines 101-104), but is cell occupied by root network component

how to grow roots? maybe just set it.  use the component we already have -- allow an action to start the root pathing process.

root connection to cleaner --> enables building.  how are roots built?
don't forget --> roots can gain you resources.


next to do:
- roots enable buildings -- do an enable component... then we can centralize all the "is enabled" stuff...
- certain building connected to roots required to clean pollution level 2

GAMEPLAY IDEAS:

ROOTS:
- roots grow faster the closer they are to the cleaner building.
- all buildings require roots connection to function
- roots allow you to select a target - they grow towards the selected target.
- Root growth required for certain operations in trees.  Root growth -> diminishing returns so you need a certain density of trees.
- maybe simplify the pollution blocking?  i like the transform into building thing, but i think using the two guys - plant and mushroom - isn't great.  instead,
	let's use mushrooms--pick up spores, must plant the spores on a dead tree.  the dead tree should disintegrate.  a tree can always turn into a dead tree.
- roots provide stat spreading
- separate building for growing plants.  you grow into it.
- drop inventory when you die
- healer building
- links between trees can improve the total number you can build.  

RESEARCH:
- research tree?

WINNING/LOSING:
- more interesting win condition
- drop inventory ability
- blocker objects expendable as they clean pollution
- could do a progression --> find the p source for basic, clean it, plant it -- gives you some resource to clean the next level.  find that, clean it, clean up all 
	pollution, you win --> i like it.

BUILDINGS/PLANTING:
- mushrooms decompose trees

INTERACTION WITH HUMANS:
- >>>>tech is human waste -- need to research it.<<<<
	>>>>so e.g., one drop could be a book...  clean it to learn human language.  lots of other drops possible.
	maybe horrified by things like chainsaws, other forestry type equipment.<<<<

DROPS/ITEMS:
- rare drop items

ABILITIES:
- high level actor unit can make super clean/block building
- higher pollution ability --> better ability -- faster, more squares, maybe better drops/discoveries
- collectable skills (e.g., from drops)

POLLUTION:
- buildings required near advanced pollution to clean it.
- dynamically changing pollution grow speed based on number of pollution-free squares? -- that's a cool way to make the game harder as you go along
- block pollution building only slows it, not totally blocks it.
- different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

STATS:
- buildings take on the stats of the unit that creates them
      two abilities: one as a unit, one as a building
      abilities spread through the root networks
- cleaning pollution stat brings you a building for cleaning pollution off things (seeds)
- idea: trees can have pollution of varying severity/difficulty to clean up.  better units are harvested from more polluted trees.
- idea: cleaning pollution stat --> pollution blocking radius on buildings.
- harvested units have randomized stats

WATER:
- something with water -- build bridges (how?).  walk on water?  clean pollution on water?

EXTRA:
- underground "streams" of pollution?  cause pollution to pop up under your stuff?
- pipe to send pollution out to human settlements
- mobile enemies?  loggers?  exterminators?
- spawn things like mosquitos to fend off humans.  maybe can be done by creating a pool of standing water.
- spawn animals to create diseases to fend off humans.
- threat meter, warning meter.  more you do, higher it goes, threats get worse.
- go/build on water (to clean pollution)...
- you can build an area -- the area defines how many units you can have.  
- re sentience: maybe you get abilities as a forest itself...
- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???) --> i don't' think this meshes with the flavor of "cleaning" the forest.  
	except maybe something like restoring bodies of water.

UI/EOU Fixes:
- fix selectable to cycle through objects in a tile.
- need to make sure roots don't grow inside of trees (just remove certain first nodes).
- context click for buildings too... see if we can generalize the actorunitcontextclick.
- area of effect tools
- units shouldn't stack
- queue unit actions (w/ visual feedback)
- debug mouseover -- give it a timer to limit update frequency.
- add an info panel for the unit you clicked on
- need to refactor the unitactioncontextclick
- need to make the pollution sources as buildings.
- pollution source manager
- game state manager w/ win/loss
- game state manager checks pollution source manager
- add: error/status messages in game.
- since cleaning pollution will be such a big part of the game, i think we need to reduce the number of clicks necessary.  we can go with the "Traditional" method of 
	removing control of individual units and just designating orders for parts of the map.  but i think an intermediate method of allowing dragged rectangles for cleaning 
	would be best.  try it out and see if not.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS:
Move placement cursor into the place building tool?

if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
