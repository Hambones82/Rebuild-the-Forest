- i think roots to function would be a good idea...

- i wonder if i can make an interesting game JUST from theh idea of these blockers and pollution effects???
	- could be at the very least an interesting prototype...

- powerful one-off items could be interesting...

- maybe the system is assigning a specific unit to perform a specific set of tasks, rather than just "whoever"

- we could also have different actions such as "clean area" or "patrol area"

- maybe terrain should be a more long term goal.  i think we need to focus on the fuel idea and how you get into the pollution areas, as well as what you need to do to win.  we have basically one mechanic now - the fueled blocking and we need other fun, synergistic things.

- probably need to do a lot of graph coloring algo stuff...

- ditches and other terrain shaping could be part of the way to deal with more complex pollution.

- i think the best thing i could do if i want to go this direction is to build out these systems in a very flexible way...  

- terrain could be quite interest... e.g., ditches to suck down the pollution...  sounds very complicated to implement but could add a very interesting strategic depth, especially if implemented with bridges...

- another idea is that pollution gets stuck to your bottom and you spread it while walking

- other ideas include that the types should...  be harder to clean as they get more serious (e.g., red > black > white)...  and we also do have those movement/damage/whatever effects...

- last thing is to add a visual effect where the shield depletion hits the shield.

- so this i think is feeling pretty good...  

- upon leveling up pollution clean, can make a building that actively cleans pollution...  but level up itself makes the pollution clean speed higher, potentially even adds effects (e.g., added pollution clean range).

ideas: maybe you need items to move trees?  i.e., find an item, revert the guy?

next things:

- need to subscribe an effect to MapEffectComponent.NotifyEffect
- so there's a question of... if our lower priority pollution exists and a higher prio one would overwrite...  is it blocked...
- i think we should call the... pollutionisblocked whenever it is blocked even if there's a potential overwrite...
- so our effects have a "source"...  now what we need is... in our "is blocked" thing for pollution...  we need to "hit" the source of the pol.  so... a new component?  maybe yes... pollution blocked damageable?
-- so we need to...  have a component that is supposed to do stuff when pollution would go.  call the trigger for that in our block thing...
--- maybe that component should register with pollution manager and pollution manager will do its event thing...???  i think that might
	be too slow??
- deprioritize recently cleaned squares for receiving new pollution.  


- slow down pollution spread maybe?

- weird input bug with mouse -- null reference exception in ObjectSelected...

- "mush dead" building can be implemented with inventory rather then the specialized bool (?) now used

- refactor the pollution manager stuff?  there's way too many classes -- pollution manager, pollution type controller, basic pollution controller...  way too much stuff.  probably would benefit just from being one class, i think

maybe for gridmap things -- give an error that the thing must be a child of a gridmap...?
	- could do this both runtime and in editor


so first -- building inventory...  
	- might have to fix how the pollution block spread works
	- map effect - block - when inventor has fuel in it

	- actor unit can place the fuel in there - what is fuel?  mushroom?  clean mushroom?
		- not sure...  maybe... the building itself specifies what fuel it can have...  ok.  
		- fuel component maybe?
	- when pollution would spawn in block area, the fuel is depleted
	- when fuel is 0, map effect goes away...

	- for this purpose, need to figure out how we even set the map effects...  might hard to put in there...

	- maybe redo the pollutionblockoverlaytilemap as it's quite messy and was kind of an ad hoc bandaid...  
	- but we don't really even need to use this for now...
	- the pollution thing is on the scriptableobject of pollutiondata...?  that's quite indirect...   


		cool, inventory has nothing to do with actorunit, so i can put this on buildings...  let's do that for the blocker.
	- will need to make a "store" action that involves storing the thingy in the building
	- i guess "effect" that will "deplete" the item...

- things like mushrooms get put into blocker inventory. Lose charges when pollution “would” hit.  
- killing pollution improves pollution kill stat, making a pollution kill building available.  
- poll kill building has a p kill aura whose rate of p kill strength depends on stat.

Like w xcom, they come at you w weapons and you can research them.

Maybe that building - the brain - is the one we want to be the one that can lose.

Alarm and terror.  Alarm is their strength.  Terror is how afraid they are.


so i think i need to make some changes to the pollution spread -- should spread from pollution spreader objects?



Need some basic combination of these things to get a satisfying game loop with win/lose condition...
Test out a bunch of building ideas.  I think we've created enough systems.
	- one idea is a low angle sprayer that sprays/deletes pollution
	- other blockers?
	- trainers (train up the units stats)?
	- planters/growers?
	- buildings for more advanced pollution
	- objects to research?



Definitely feels good to find thingies under the pollution.  The cleaning thing feels decent but gets repetitive very quickly.
RN, let's add things.  maybe add new pickups and thus buildings/things you can make...

One of the main things should be...  getting more little guys.  They can be locked behind different obstacles...

I think we need to prioritize the good ideas.  Right now there's maybe 3-5 minutes of interesting gameplay.  How do we extend this?
I think the main idea that games like this use to keep interest is changing up the gameplay loop.  Gameplay loop evolves as you progress.
We need to implement ideas to do this.  I have no idea whether any of the main mechanics are actually good.  Maybe let's stick with some
of what we have an continue from there.

OK... we have a roots idea...???  This was obviously not implemented..  
ABOVE: Coming back after 2 years
=======


- so we have to check connectivity pretty frequently i think -- basically... any time we need to know whether a building is operating
- so...  doing a pathfinder every frame is probably not going to be great.  actually it would be multiple pathfinders -- one for each building that can be enabled
--> isn't this just a "graph coloring" thing?  why path find every time, that makes no sense...
- so we will have to do the custom function for this... ok fine let's just do it
- root network node is a building component.  it has a network id, which is set by the root manager.
- resources on the map.  link up a root to gain access to those resources.  use them up, the resources deplete.  
- build a root...  how do we limit this.  

set the origin for root growth as the closest point in the building to the target.
use the midpoint of the building as the origin point for the radius.  alternatively, use the closest point from the building.
need to work out the root network thing...  
-- let's try to do it with...  the pathfinder... put a pathfinder in ...  the root manager.
otherwise we need a special root walker...  

next to do:
- roots enable buildings -- do an enable component... then we can centralize all the "is enabled" stuff...
- certain building connected to roots required to clean pollution level 2

GAMEPLAY IDEAS:

ROOTS:
- roots grow faster the closer they are to the cleaner building.
- all buildings require roots connection to function
- roots allow you to select a target - they grow towards the selected target.
- Root growth required for certain operations in trees.  Root growth -> diminishing returns so you need a certain density of trees.
- maybe simplify the pollution blocking?  i like the transform into building thing, but i think using the two guys - plant and mushroom - isn't great.  instead,
	let's use mushrooms--pick up spores, must plant the spores on a dead tree.  the dead tree should disintegrate.  a tree can always turn into a dead tree.
- roots provide stat spreading
- separate building for growing plants.  you grow into it.
- drop inventory when you die
- healer building
- links between trees can improve the total number you can build.  

RESEARCH:
- research tree?

WINNING/LOSING:
- more interesting win condition
- drop inventory ability
- blocker objects expendable as they clean pollution
- could do a progression --> find the p source for basic, clean it, plant it -- gives you some resource to clean the next level.  find that, clean it, clean up all 
	pollution, you win --> i like it.

BUILDINGS/PLANTING:
- mushrooms decompose trees
- ???
INTERACTION WITH HUMANS:
- >>>>tech is human waste -- need to research it.<<<<
	>>>>so e.g., one drop could be a book...  clean it to learn human language.  lots of other drops possible.
	maybe horrified by things like chainsaws, other forestry type equipment.<<<<

DROPS/ITEMS:
- rare drop items

ABILITIES:
- high level actor unit can make super clean/block building
- higher pollution ability --> better ability -- faster, more squares, maybe better drops/discoveries
- collectable skills (e.g., from drops)

POLLUTION:
- buildings required near advanced pollution to clean it.
- dynamically changing pollution grow speed based on number of pollution-free squares? -- that's a cool way to make the game harder as you go along
- block pollution building only slows it, not totally blocks it.
- different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

STATS:
- buildings take on the stats of the unit that creates them
      two abilities: one as a unit, one as a building
      abilities spread through the root networks
- cleaning pollution stat brings you a building for cleaning pollution off things (seeds)
- idea: trees can have pollution of varying severity/difficulty to clean up.  better units are harvested from more polluted trees.
- idea: cleaning pollution stat --> pollution blocking radius on buildings.
- harvested units have randomized stats

WATER:
- something with water -- build bridges (how?).  walk on water?  clean pollution on water?

EXTRA:
- underground "streams" of pollution?  cause pollution to pop up under your stuff?
- pipe to send pollution out to human settlements
- mobile enemies?  loggers?  exterminators?
- spawn things like mosquitos to fend off humans.  maybe can be done by creating a pool of standing water.
- spawn animals to create diseases to fend off humans.
- threat meter, warning meter.  more you do, higher it goes, threats get worse.
- go/build on water (to clean pollution)...
- you can build an area -- the area defines how many units you can have.  
- re sentience: maybe you get abilities as a forest itself...
- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???) --> i don't' think this meshes with the flavor of "cleaning" the forest.  
	except maybe something like restoring bodies of water.

UI/EOU Fixes:
- fix selectable to cycle through objects in a tile.
- need to make sure roots don't grow inside of trees (just remove certain first nodes).
- context click for buildings too... see if we can generalize the actorunitcontextclick.
- area of effect tools
- units shouldn't stack
- queue unit actions (w/ visual feedback)
- debug mouseover -- give it a timer to limit update frequency.
- add an info panel for the unit you clicked on
- need to refactor the unitactioncontextclick
- need to make the pollution sources as buildings.
- pollution source manager
- game state manager w/ win/loss
- game state manager checks pollution source manager
- add: error/status messages in game.
- since cleaning pollution will be such a big part of the game, i think we need to reduce the number of clicks necessary.  we can go with the "Traditional" method of 
	removing control of individual units and just designating orders for parts of the map.  but i think an intermediate method of allowing dragged rectangles for cleaning 
	would be best.  try it out and see if not.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS:
Maybe we want to get rid of all the singletons and just do "findobjectinscene" which really isn't that terrible if you do it once...
I think I'd rather have that because it would have all references be to actual objects in the scene rather than based on some c# statics.
This would allow normal scene cleanup, etc., to properly delete all the old stuff, etc...  I hope.

Move placement cursor into the place building tool?

if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
