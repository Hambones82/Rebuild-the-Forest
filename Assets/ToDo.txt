- move on to building spawn ui.  need to do the ui for it.  create a build button class.  should just accept button type and handle everything else.  fill the panel up with those
- panel should have its own class that decides how to fill the buttons.
- this way, we'll be able to transform a pawn into a building.


- ok what i want to do is:
a) provide a list of buildings taht can be built upon clicking on a guy
	- create a panel to show a list of buildings.
	- the panel has a behavior that should monitor various features like unit skills as compared with building requirements
	- let's create our first building and see if we can get this stuff to work.  
b) provide the functionality for indicating that such building should be placed.  the previous "cursor" and thing to be placed, etc., stuff can be helpful.
c) provide the functionality for actually building the buildings


- include data into scriptable object

-idea - different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

- again, get core game down first.

- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???)

//cancels for actions... ok but not necessary right now.
if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
