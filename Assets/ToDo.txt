fix the button refresh thing.  you should only add buttons if you don't have them already.


make the block pollution effect actually slow/stop pollution spread



gameplay ideas:
building to spawn actor units
building to affect pollution
to function, buildings must be significantly pollution free
individual actor units can clean pollution, but better to automate
we probably need an "effects" layer --> lets entities check its status, affects gameplay, allows for visualization.
when a building is built or destroyed, update effects layer.
effects layer structure...  would be nice if it was a series of layers, where each was associated with a particular effect.  we might(?) have a mechanism for this alr?
--- so we do have the "Grid sub maps..."  can these work?
ok... the thing with grid sub maps is they require grid cells/grid transforms, which we don't want.
i think the easiest way to do this would just be have a completely independent component that handles effects.


-idea - different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

- again, get core game down first.

- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???) --> i don't' think this meshes with the flavor of "cleaning" the forest

//cancels for actions... ok but not necessary right now.
if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
