healing action.

have a text effects static class that just spawns floating/moving text effects for feedback (e.g., skill gains).

healing and damage

heal tree w heal aura

visual guide for blocker area of effect

don't spawn actor on untraversable tiles
idea: threat meter, warning meter.  more you do, higher it goes, threats get worse.
add: error/status messages in game.

pollution hurts units
health --> 0 kills units
win/loss conditions

new mouse tools - ??

interface showing number of units
interface showing unit abilities

idea: harvested units have randomized states

idea: trees can have pollution of varying severity/difficulty to clean up.  better units are harvested from more polluted trees.

idea: pollution is of different kids, different stat values, so that dealing with it requires some thought.

idea: improved blocker ability (increased range).

BUG: need to check action validity on startup.  maybe make the action have its own isvalid thing.  that way we don't have to implement this stuff in an ad hoc basis.
cleaning pollution, whatever, all those things need to check if the actor unit is in the appropriate square.

mycorrhizal networks

mycorrhizal filament

abilities with cooldowns.  e.g., prevent pollution pain, prevent pollution spread.  maybe clear all pollution in a certain area...  

pollution hurts you.

links between trees can improve the total number you can build.  

since cleaning pollution will be such a big part of the game, i think we need to reduce the number of clicks necessary.  we can go with the "Traditional" method of 
removing control of individual units and just designating orders for parts of the map.  but i think an intermediate method of allowing dragged rectangles for cleaning would be best.  try it out and see if not.

i can definitely see why the "traditional" method is appealing -- selecting different units and clicking with them is very tedious.

there are other possible solutions, though... you could just have each of the guys have side icons that maybe even indicate what they're doing, and then click on those icons
to subsequently set orders.

IDEA: you have to search for pollution sources to uncover them.


BUG: buildings can end up overlapping, probably if you ask two actors to build the buildings.  the transform into building function needs a check when it's about to happen.



ok it's annoying that i can't clean the pollution on water... but maybe i can use that as a motivation...
upgrade: unit prevent pollution spawn aura

then i need to implement map changes (traversible) on build buildings and on change terrain (terrain can be deferred)


can't operate buildings covered in pollution.



elements: 
5) research? - ???

idea: 

again, eventually, try to clean all pollution on map

eventually, add higher level of pollution.  maybe this spreads more slowly but is harder to clear.


change color as they become more experienced (to prevent people from turning their really good ones into buildings)

go/build on water (to clean pollution)...
do a research thing.  that'll be a lot of work

but first let's do canceling unit actions

gameplay: cleaning up pollution gives a block pollution ability.  choice is whether to focus all cleaning on one guy, thus improving stat or let all guys clean.  

-------------------------------------------

- the units can hit a button to hold position and keep the pollution at bay.  this prevents pollution from spawning in a certain area around the unit.  the unit will gain
pollution stoppage skill while doing this.
- the units can also clean the pollution, which we've already implemented.
if the pollution starts out covering the entire field (or most of it), then it makes sense to try to get multiple units in -- some cleaning and some keeping the pollution at bay, and then having one of them make a "stay at bay" building and one make a "spawn" building.
- do the above as a base, core mechanic.  goal is to clear the field.

--> ok, above makes sense.

idea--> level 2 pollution -- maybe slower spreading... but need to upgrade yourselves to clean it/keep it at bay.

so part of the progression/constant danger is that the pollution is constantly spreading.

idea--> you can build an area -- the area defines how many units you can have.  

so you win if there is no pollution left in the whole level.


gameplay ideas:
to function, buildings must be significantly pollution free
individual actor units can clean pollution, but better to automate

-idea - underground "streams" of pollution?  cause pollution to pop up under your stuff?
-idea - different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

- again, get core game down first.

- gameplay - human units come in, need to deal with them in different ways

- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???) --> i don't' think this meshes with the flavor of "cleaning" the forest.  except maybe something like restoring bodies of water.

//cancels for actions... ok but not necessary right now.
if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
