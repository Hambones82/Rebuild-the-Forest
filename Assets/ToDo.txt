i think there is one bug with pathfinding which is that it makes weird diagonal moves sometimes.  i think this is because the g function isn't working as intended.

then i need to implement map changes (traversible) on build buildings and on change terrain (terrain can be deferred)


tiledatatype seems pointless...

change color as they become more experienced (to prevent people from turning their really good ones into buildings)

spawner requires actor unit time.  an actor unit must operate it.

fix the pollution spawner thing (performance?).
go/build on water (to clean pollution)...
do a research thing.  that'll be a lot of work

i probably should implement real pathfinding.
but first let's do canceling unit actions

gameplay: cleaning up pollution gives a block pollution ability.  choice is whether to focus all cleaning on one guy, thus improving stat or let all guys clean.  

-------------------------------------------

- the units can hit a button to hold position and keep the pollution at bay.  this prevents pollution from spawning in a certain area around the unit.  the unit will gain
pollution stoppage skill while doing this.
- the units can also clean the pollution, which we've already implemented.
if the pollution starts out covering the entire field (or most of it), then it makes sense to try to get multiple units in -- some cleaning and some keeping the pollution at bay, and then having one of them make a "stay at bay" building and one make a "spawn" building.
- do the above as a base, core mechanic.  goal is to clear the field.

--> ok, above makes sense.

idea--> level 2 pollution -- maybe slower spreading... but need to upgrade yourselves to clean it/keep it at bay.

so part of the progression/constant danger is that the pollution is constantly spreading.

idea--> you can build an area -- the area defines how many units you can have.  

so you win if there is no pollution left in the whole level.


gameplay ideas:
to function, buildings must be significantly pollution free
individual actor units can clean pollution, but better to automate


-idea - different types of pollution.  e.g., appliances, sludge, nuclear stuff.  different ways to clean it up

- again, get core game down first.

- gameplay - human units come in, need to deal with them in different ways

- in addition to cleaning pollution, need to terraform (e.g., remove water/whatever...) (???) --> i don't' think this meshes with the flavor of "cleaning" the forest.  except maybe something like restoring bodies of water.

//cancels for actions... ok but not necessary right now.
if any action cannot happen, the entire queue should get dropped.
